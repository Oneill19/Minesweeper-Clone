Minesweeper clone I built using Java and Javafx in my second year java course.

mines package

- Mines.java is the logic of the game, creating the matrix of the game, add mines, toggle flags and handle the all the game logic.

- MinesController.java is the controller of the SceneBuilder part of the project, this part is creating the main window, the reset button and the input values.

- minesFX.fxml is the file created with SceneBuilder.

- MinesFX.java is all the visual aspect of the game, creating a grid to represent the game board, the images of every grid and the win and lose windows.

The game using images and sound effect.
