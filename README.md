# Minesweeper Clone
Minesweeper clone I built using Java and Javafx in my second year java course.

mines package

1. Mines.java is the logic of the game, creating the matrix of the game, add mines, toggle flags and handle the all the game logic.
2. MinesController.java is the controller of the SceneBuilder part of the project, this part is creating the main window, the reset button and the input values.
3. minesFX.fxml is the file created with SceneBuilder.
4. MinesFX.java is all the visual aspect of the game, creating a grid to represent the game board, the images of every grid and the win and lose windows.

The game using images and sound effect.
